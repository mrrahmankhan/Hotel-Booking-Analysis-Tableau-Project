# Hotel Booking Analysis – Tableau Project
The Hotel Booking Analysis Project aimed to explore hotel booking trends using Tableau. This project provided valuable insights into booking patterns, customer preferences, and key factors influencing hotel reservations.

Data Overview & Analysis
The dataset included information on hotel types, booking sources, seasonal trends, cancellation rates, and guest demographics. I structured the data and leveraged interactive Tableau dashboards to uncover meaningful insights.

Key Insights & Findings:

✅ Hotel Booking Trends
City Hotels (66.45%) had a significantly higher number of bookings compared to Resort Hotels (33.55%).
Bookings fluctuated over 2015-2017, with 2016 having the highest number of reservations (~38,140).

✅ Seasonality & Peak Periods
August had the highest number of bookings, making it a peak season for both City and Resort Hotels.
January and November had the lowest bookings, indicating an off-season period.

✅ Market Segment Performance
Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) accounted for the majority of bookings (56,477), followed by Offline Travel Agents/Tour Operators (24,219) and Group bookings (19,811).
Direct bookings (12,606) were relatively lower, indicating the dominance of third-party platforms.

✅ Booking Cancellations & Customer Behavior
Cancellations were significant, with City Hotels experiencing more cancellations than Resort Hotels.
Many guests had prior bookings, indicating a pattern of repeat visitors.

✅ Guest Demographics & Preferences
Guests came from a diverse range of countries, highlighting the hotels’ international reach.
Weekday vs. Weekend stays varied, with City Hotels showing higher weekday stays while Resort Hotels saw a balance between weekdays and weekends.


Tableau Dashboards & Visualizations:

To represent these insights effectively, I created interactive Tableau dashboards with:
📊 Bar charts – Comparing hotel bookings over the years
📉 Line graphs – Seasonal trends in bookings
📌 Pie charts – Market segment distribution
🌍 Geospatial maps – Guest origins by country
📈 Stacked charts – Cancellation trends and booking behaviors

Conclusion & Business Impact
The analysis provided actionable insights for hotel management, revenue optimization, and customer engagement strategies:
✅ Adjust pricing and promotions during peak/off-peak seasons
✅ Enhance direct booking strategies to reduce dependency on OTAs
✅ Improve cancellation policies to minimize lost revenue
✅ Target key guest demographics to increase repeat customers

By leveraging Tableau’s powerful visualization capabilities, I transformed raw data into clear, data-driven insights, enabling hotels to enhance their operations and customer experience.
